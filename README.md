- ⚡ Fun fact:

    📚 Lifelong Learner: I’m always curious and love picking up new skills or knowledge—whether it's something practical or just totally random. Learning never stops for me!
    
    💻 Screen Time, Smart Time: If I’m not travelling, you’ll usually find me in front of a monitor, exploring new topics, experimenting, or just feeding my curiosity with spontaneous learning sessions.
    
    🛠️ Break to Build: I believe in learning by doing—and often, by breaking. Reverse engineering has become a core part of how I understand systems. Whether it’s a bottom-up deep dive or a top-down overview, I adapt my approach based on the complexity, time, and end goal.
    
    🌊 Weekend Wanderer: Life gets busy and I rarely get time to myself—but when I do, especially on weekends, I often head out with a mind full of tasks. The moment I hit the beach or find myself in the wilderness, everything resets. It’s like nature flips a switch to calm, clarity, and mindfulness.
