## üîπ Lambda Calculus (Alonzo Church, 1903‚Äì1995)

* **Definition**: A formal system (1930s) for expressing computation via **function abstraction and application**.
* Everything in lambda calculus is built from:

  * **Variables**
  * **Functions (Œª-expressions)**
  * **Applications (applying a function to an argument)**

üëâ Example:
The function $f(x) = x + 1$ in lambda calculus is written as:

$$
\lambda x. (x+1)
$$

If we apply it to `2`:

$$
(\lambda x. (x+1)) \; 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3
$$

So, lambda calculus is basically **mathematics of computation**.

## üîπ Equivalence of Formalisms

In the 1930s, multiple definitions of ‚Äúeffective computability‚Äù emerged:

1. **Turing Machines** (Alan Turing, 1936) ‚Üí abstract machines manipulating symbols on tape.
2. **Lambda Calculus** (Alonzo Church) ‚Üí rewriting symbolic expressions.
3. **Recursive Functions** (G√∂del, Kleene).

**Key result**:

* These different models all compute the **same set of functions**.
* Meaning: what is computable in one model is computable in all the others.

## üîπ The Church‚ÄìTuring Thesis

* **Statement**:

  > Anything that can be effectively computed (i.e., by an algorithm) can be computed by a Turing machine (or equivalently, in lambda calculus).

* It‚Äôs **not a formal theorem** (because ‚Äúeffectively computable‚Äù is an intuitive notion), but it‚Äôs a widely accepted principle in computer science.

* It forms the **foundation of modern computer science**: programming languages, compilers, and AI are all ultimately rooted in these models.

‚úÖ **Why it matters for AI**:

* AI is built on the assumption that **intelligence is computable**.
* If human reasoning can be formalized, it should, in theory, be representable in **lambda calculus, recursive functions, or a Turing machine**.
* That‚Äôs why Buchanan (2005) included this in his history: it‚Äôs the bridge between **mathematical theory** and **building real intelligent systems**.
