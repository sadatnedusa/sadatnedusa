#  *“A (Very) Brief History of Artificial Intelligence”*.

---

## 🔹 Bruce Buchanan (2005) — **Summary of Bruce G. Buchanan’s 2005 paper**

### 1. **Roots in Imagination**

* Human fantasies of artificial beings predate science:

  * Homer’s *Iliad* → mechanical “tripods” serving the gods.
  * Medieval legends of automata, golems, and mechanical helpers.
* These early stories represent **our cultural desire** for mechanical intelligence.

---

### 2. **Birth of AI as a Field (1950s)**

* **Alan Turing (1950)** – proposed the “Turing Test” in *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*, asking *“Can machines think?”*.
* **1956 Dartmouth Conference** – considered the **founding moment of AI**, where John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon gathered to formalize the field.
* Early optimism: researchers believed human-level AI could be achieved within a generation.

---

### 3. **Early Demonstrations (1950s–1960s)**

* **Logic-based AI** – Allen Newell & Herbert Simon’s *Logic Theorist* (1956) could prove mathematical theorems.
* **Search-based programs** – General Problem Solver (GPS).
* **Game playing** – programs for checkers and chess.
* These were **proof-of-concept demonstrations** showing machines could simulate reasoning.

---

### 4. **Expansion into Knowledge-Based Systems (1970s–1980s)**

* AI shifted from **general reasoning** to **domain-specific expertise**.
* **Expert systems** emerged:

  * *DENDRAL* (chemistry, molecule identification).
  * *MYCIN* (medicine, diagnosing infections).
* Knowledge was encoded as **rules** rather than abstract logic.
* This led to AI being useful in **applied problem solving**.

---

### 5. **AI Winters & Renewed Growth**

* **Overpromises** led to funding cuts (“AI winters”) in the 1970s and late 1980s.
* Still, progress continued in:

  * Machine learning (early neural nets, decision trees).
  * Robotics.
  * Natural language processing.
* Key lesson: AI is a **long-term research field**, not a quick-fix.

---

### 6. **Modern AI Directions (1990s–2000s)**

* Growth in **machine learning** (statistical models, probabilistic reasoning).
* AI integrating with **medicine, engineering, law**.
* Buchanan emphasized AI as **an experimental science**: testing hypotheses about intelligence, not just building applications.
* Quote you shared reflects this: AI shifted from **fantasy → possibility → demonstration → promise**.

---

### 7. **Buchanan’s Reflection**

* AI is a **scientific discipline**, like physics or biology:

  * It builds **theories of intelligence**.
  * It tests those theories with **working machines**.
* The real importance of AI is not just making “smart machines,” but **understanding intelligence itself**.

---

✅ **In essence**: Buchanan (2005) traces AI’s path from **mythology → early programs → expert systems → modern machine learning**, while stressing AI’s role as a *science of intelligence* that uses machines as experimental models.
